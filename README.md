# AWS EC2 Deployment and Management

Designed and implemented a scalable architecture using Amazon EC2 to host a multi-tier application.

Tools:  Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing(ELB), Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Systems Manager, IAM, Security Group.

1. Utilized EC2 Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on traffic demand, ensuring high availability and performance.

2. Deployed instances in different Availability Zones for redundancy and fault tolerance.

3. Implemented Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, improving responsiveness and reliability.

4. Configured Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring instance performance, setting up alarms for CPU utilization and other key metrics.

5. Automated deployment and management tasks using AWS Systems Manager, including patch management and configuration updates.

6. Secured EC2 instances with AWS IAM roles and Security Groups, ensuring least privilege access and data protection.
