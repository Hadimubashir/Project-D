# 🖥️ AWS EC2 Deployment and Management

Designed and deployed a scalable and secure architecture using **Amazon EC2** to host a multi-tier web application with high availability, performance, and automation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Auto Scaling
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- Amazon CloudWatch
- AWS Systems Manager
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Security Groups

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

- **Auto Scaling**:  
  Configured **EC2 Auto Scaling** to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on real-time traffic, ensuring scalability and availability.

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**:  
  Launched EC2 instances in multiple **Availability Zones** to provide fault tolerance and minimize downtime.

- **Load Balancing**:  
  Used **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to distribute traffic evenly across EC2 instances for better responsiveness and reliability.

- **Monitoring & Alerts**:  
  Enabled **Amazon CloudWatch** for detailed monitoring, setting up alarms for critical metrics like CPU usage and memory.

- **Automation with Systems Manager**:  
  Utilized **AWS Systems Manager** to automate patch management, run commands, and manage configurations securely across instances.

- **Security**:  
  Enforced **IAM roles** for controlled access and **Security Groups** for network-level protection, following the principle of least privilege.

## 🚀 Outcome
- Highly available and scalable infrastructure
- Automated monitoring and management
- Enhanced security and centralized control
